# Buy & Build Strategy Engine - Behavioral Rules

## Investment Thesis
- This platform supports the **AI-Enabled MSP Platform** investment strategy
- See `docs/INVESTMENT_THESIS.md` for the complete investment thesis
- Target profile: £500k–£1m EBITDA, 70%+ recurring revenue, Microsoft-centric, SIC codes 62020/62090

## Source of Truth
- All company data lives in `/data/companies` as `{company_number}.json`
- Each file represents a single company record
- The file-based database is the single source of truth

## Persistence over Volatility
- If an enrichment step fails, DO NOT delete the record
- Update the metadata with `enrichment_status: "failed"` flag
- Preserve all existing data, even if partial
- Log errors but maintain data integrity

## Agent-First Workflow
- When asked to "Enrich X", execute the script directly
- Check for errors after execution
- Summarize findings in the console
- Verify output matches expected schema
- Take responsibility for script execution and validation

## Governance
- Every company added to the database MUST be validated against CompanySchema
- No "Dirty Data" is allowed in the repository
- Use Zod validation before writing any company file
- Reject invalid data at the source

## Data Integrity
- Always validate before write operations
- Maintain backward compatibility when schema evolves
- Use Git for versioning the file-based database
- Never overwrite valid data with invalid data

## Terminal as UI
- All output should be console-based
- Use high-contrast ASCII for dashboards
- No web interfaces or Tailwind
- Focus on readability in terminal

## Documentation Strategy
- See `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` for complete documentation guidelines
- **Operational Docs** (keep in `/docs`): Documents that explain how the system works NOW
  - Examples: API behavior, operational guides, business logic, system architecture
  - These help agents understand current system behavior
- **Historical/Development Docs** (archive in `/docs/archive`): Documents about past work
  - Examples: Code reviews, refactoring plans, completed phase summaries
  - These document what was done, not how the system works
- **Root-Level Docs** (keep in root): Entry points and quick references
  - Examples: README.md, RUN_SCRAPER.md, TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **When creating new docs**:
  - If it explains current system behavior → `/docs/`
  - If it documents completed work/history → `/docs/archive/`
  - If it's a quick reference/entry point → root directory
  - If unsure, prefer `/docs/archive/` for historical content
- **Documentation Principles**:
  - Operational > Historical (keep current behavior docs, archive past work)
  - Reference > Narrative (explain "how it works" not "what we did")
  - Living > Static (update or remove outdated docs)
  - Actionable > Descriptive (help agents make decisions)
