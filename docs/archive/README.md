# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical and development documentation that is no longer actively maintained or referenced.

## Contents

- **CODE_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md** - Initial code review from refactoring work (Phase 1 complete)
- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - Original refactoring plan (Phase 1 complete, Phases 2-3 remain)
- **REFACTORING_EXAMPLES.md** - Examples from Phase 1 refactoring work
- **PHASE1_COMPLETE.md** - Summary of Phase 1 refactoring completion

## Why Archived?

These documents describe **past work** rather than **current system behavior**. They are preserved for historical reference but are not needed for understanding how the system currently works.

For current operational documentation, see the parent `/docs/` directory.

## Note for Agents

When searching for information about how the system works, prioritize:
1. `/docs/` - Current operational documentation
2. Root-level docs (README.md, etc.) - Entry points
3. `/docs/archive/` - Historical context only
