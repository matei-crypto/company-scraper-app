# AI-Enabled MSP Platform – Investment Thesis

## Executive Summary

We are building a next-generation MSP platform that leverages AI and automation to transform traditional IT support relationships into embedded "managed intelligence" partnerships. Our strategy capitalises on a specific market inefficiency: Private Equity firms largely ignore MSPs in the £500k–£1m EBITDA range, £3m–£6m revenue range, or 15–40 employee range. By targeting this "PE Void," we can acquire assets at highly attractive multiples (5x or lower) and execute operational transformations that are impossible in larger, more rigid organisations.

Our approach is built on a three-tier execution strategy:

1. **Optimise**: Acquire a single "platform asset" and prove the AI margin expansion thesis.
2. **Scale**: Aggressively roll up similar small entities into this validated core architecture.
3. **Transform**: Pivot from pure support to deploying AI agents and workflows directly into client businesses.

## Market Opportunity: The "PE Void"

The UK MSP market is fragmented. Large consolidators and PE firms struggle to deploy capital efficiently into businesses generating less than £2m EBITDA, leaving a rich seam of high-quality, stable assets in the £500k–£1m EBITDA range, £3m–£6m revenue range, or 15–40 employee range.

**Valuation Arbitrage**: Because these assets are "sub-scale" for institutional money, they trade at 4x–5x EBITDA, significantly lower than the 8x–10x commanded by larger platforms.

**Agility Advantage**: Smaller MSPs have less technical debt and cultural inertia. Standardising tooling and processes—often the graveyard of large integrations—is significantly easier. The change management burden is lower, allowing us to deploy our AI-enabled operating model rapidly and effectively.

## Strategic Execution Plan

### Phase 1: The "Golden Copy" (Month 0–12)

The goal is not immediate volume, but operational perfection. We will acquire one high-quality, Microsoft-centric MSP and use it as a laboratory to build the platform.

- **Objective**: Demonstrate measurable margin improvement through technology.
- **Method**: We will deploy AI not just for ticket resolution, but to automate the standardisation process itself (e.g., automated configuration mapping and documentation).
- **Result**: A fully optimised "Platform Node" with a proven playbook for migrating clients and engineers.

### Phase 2: The Aggressive Roll-up (Month 12–36)

Once the Service Desk automation yields real, measurable time savings, we begin acquiring similar profile competitors.

- **Integration**: We do not run a federation. New acquisitions are immediately migrated to our core tech stack and processes.
- **Synergy Realisation**: We absorb revenue without proportional headcount growth. Margin expansion is achieved through natural employee attrition and increased capacity per head, rather than disruptive lay-offs.

### Phase 3: The Client AI Transformation (Month 36+)

With a scaled platform and deep trusted access to client data, we move into the final tier: embedding AI into the customer's own revenue-generating workflows.

- **Objective**: Support clients in building AI capabilities within their own businesses.
- **Method**: We leverage our internal expertise to sell AI solutions built on top of the Microsoft stack (Copilot Studio, Power Automate). This involves deploying custom AI agents, designing AI-driven workflows, and automating complex business processes for our client base. We will be perfectly positioned to upsell into our client base both because we already support their IT systems and data but also because we'll have the technical knowhow from having transformed our own business with the same technologies we'll be deploying into theirs.
- **Result**: We transition from a cost-centre (IT Support) to a value-driver, deepening client stickiness and opening new high-margin revenue streams.

## The Platform & Tech Stack

To support the "Golden Copy" and subsequent roll-up, we require a rigid, unified technical foundation.

- **Core Infrastructure**: The entry point is traditional infrastructure: managed endpoints, networks, security, and end-user support anchored in Microsoft 365 and Azure.
- **Unified Operating Environment**: The platform layer functions as a single operating environment across all acquired entities. This includes a single PSA (Professional Services Automation), RMM (Remote Monitoring and Management), shared knowledge base, and a consolidated data layer ingesting tickets, telemetry, configurations, and commercial data.
- **The AI Layer**: Upon this foundation, we will develop a focused AI and automation capability that transforms IT service delivery before progressively extending into clients' internal workflows. This data layer is critical; without it, AI cannot accurately "reason" about the estate.

## Value Creation: The AI Lever

We target an EBITDA margin expansion from the industry standard ~15% to ~30%, coupled with high-quality revenue growth.

- **Service Desk Automation**: We will implement AI agents to handle high-volume L1/L2 tasks. This reduces the human labor required for ticket triage, password resets, and basic provisioning.
- **AI-Assisted Standardisation**: Traditionally, integrating an acquired MSP is manual and slow. We will use AI tools to audit, map, and reconfigure the acquired estate, drastically reducing the "time-to-standard" and technical integration costs.
- **Operating Leverage**: As we scale, the fixed cost of our central AI and automation platform is amortised across a larger revenue base. Growth is serviced by software, not linear hiring.
- **AI-Led Revenue Growth**: In Phase 3, we unlock a new growth engine. By observing client data and ticket patterns, we identify opportunities to sell modular AI automations (e.g., intelligent document handling for lawyers). This shifts our revenue mix toward higher value-add services.

## Team & Operations

Execution demands a technical leadership team led by a Group CTO. To mitigate "J-curve" costs while proving the thesis, we will launch with a lean Initial HoldCo Team of six key individuals:

- **Group CEO**: Strategy, Investor Relations, and acting Head of M&A.
- **Group COO**: Responsible for implementing the standard operating model and day-to-day service delivery (could be the founder of the platform business but could also be (and this is preferable) in the founding team with enough MSP experience to talk the language but not too much to resist change and innovation).
- **Group CTO**: Technology vision, security architecture, and AI roadmap ownership.
- **Head of Platform**: Responsible for product strategy, commercial packaging of AI services and execution of the roadmap.
- **Lead AI Engineer**: Hands-on builder responsible for the technical integration of the first acquisition and building AI automations and core underlying hold co systems.
- **AI Engineer**: Focused on building of AI automations (e.g., password resets, triage) to demonstrate margin uplift.

As the group scales towards £5m+ EBITDA, this team will evolve into the fully functional end state. This includes adding a dedicated M&A function to drive deal velocity and a Head of People to manage cultural integration. Data and automation engineering capabilities will expand alongside the growing estate.

## Risks & Mitigation

Execution risks are the primary failure point as is typical for buy-and-build strategies.

| Risk Area | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Integration Failure** | Poorly handled standardisation can cause staff churn and client dissatisfaction. | We adhere to a rigid integration playbook. New acquisitions are immediately migrated to our common stack; we do not operate a "federation" of different systems. |
| **Focus Drift** | Scattered AI focus can delay returns and burn cash without results. | We will prioritise a small number of high-volume internal use cases with measurable margin impact (e.g., triage, resets) to ensure early momentum before tackling complex client-facing AI. |
| **Target Selection** | Buying the wrong asset complicates the "Golden Copy" phase. | We utilise a disciplined approach to target selection: £500k–£1m EBITDA, £3m–£6m revenue, or 15–40 employees; 70%+ recurring revenue; and a clear Microsoft bias. |

## Capital Structure & Funding

Given the operational heavy-lifting in Phase 1 and the long-term vision, this thesis is best suited for Patient Capital.

- **Primary Source**: Family Office or High Net Worth (Friends & Family) capital.
- **Debt**: Conservative leverage will be utilised for Phase 2 acquisitions to enhance equity returns without jeopardising stability.
- **Alignment**: This structure avoids the short-term exits forced by traditional PE lifecycles, allowing us to compound value over decades.

## Exit Strategy & Long-Term View

While this asset class is liquid and attractive to larger PE firms once scaled to £5m+ EBITDA, our preferred strategy is a Perpetual Hold.

- **The Forever Hold**: IT Managed Services are mission-critical and resistant to macro-economic shocks. By building a highly efficient, AI-optimised platform, we create a "cash cow" that can compound capital indefinitely.
- **The Strategic Off-Ramp (Post-Phase 2)**: Should we choose to exit, the optimal window opens after we have scaled the group (Phase 2) and demonstrated early traction with client-side AI revenues (Phase 3). At this inflection point, the business is no longer just a "clean MSP roll-up" but a proven "AI Transformation Platform." This dual narrative—scaled EBITDA plus a high-growth AI service line—commands a premium valuation from mid-market Private Equity firms or strategic buyers seeking immediate AI capability.

## Conclusion

We are buying stability at a discount and injecting efficiency through AI. By focusing on the £500k–£1m EBITDA range, £3m–£6m revenue range, or 15–40 employee range, we avoid competitive bidding wars and secure businesses small enough to be radically transformed. This is a low-risk entry into a high-demand market, with a clear path to doubling margins through technology and subsequently transforming revenue quality through client-side AI deployment.
